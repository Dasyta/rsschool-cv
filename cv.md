Education

2019-2023
: ** Mathematician programmer **; BSU

Short information
---------
>I was interested in the RS course since I am studying to be a programmer at the university,
but markup languages and js were not included in the university program.
And so I wanted to master the front-end on my own.
I consider myself a very creative person,
so I think that creating a beautiful interface,
whether it's websites or any application,
will really fascinate me. I am a very purposeful person, 
I always finish what I started, and I do everything with a bit of perfectionism. 
I am very hardworking and diligent, I can easily take on any amount of work.
However, due to studying at the university, I still do not have any work experience anywhere.
But now, I think, is the time to start moving up the career ladder and gain experience for future promising employment.


Experience
----------

>From my work experience, I can only indicate course projects and the report on
academic practice that we write at the university at the end of each year of study. 
I also solve puzzles on #codewars and in the iRunner system.Here are some examples of my code:

```
function isPalindrome(line) {
  let reverseLine="";
  line=String(line);
  for(let i=line.length-1;i>=0;i--){
    reverseLine+=line[i];
  }
  if(line===reverseLine)
  return true;
  else return false;
}
```
```
function even_or_odd(number) {
  if(number%2==0)
    return "Even";
  else return "Odd";
}
```
```
function findShort(s){
   let res = s.split(' ');
  let a = Infinity;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < res.length; i++) {
    a = Math.min(res[i].length, a);
  }
  return a;
}
```
```
function squareDigits(num){
  let result;
  let str="";
 while(num>0){
   str=`${(num%10)**2}`+str;
   num=Math.floor(num/10);
 }
  return +str;
 
}
```

Knowledge of languages:
----------------------------------------

     * English(B1)
     * French(B1)
     

> At school, I studied French as my primary language.
 However, after I started studying at an IT university,
 I realized the need to learn English. This is why I work
 with a grammar tutor, as well as every week we set aside
 2 hours for communication in English. In addition,
 I watch TV shows and read books in English to get used to 
*      the local vocabulary and pronunciation perception.
